  **Chord Crusher** breaks apart the mental steps you take to identify a chord. Each step draws on some piece of knowledge you’ve gained in Music 51.</p>
  <p>For the first three questions, you’ll need to be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>name the notes you see on the staff,</li>
    <li>identify which of those notes is the root note of the chord,</li>
    <li>know which Major and minor keys correspond to a given key signature,</li>
    <li>and translate the root note to a degree of the key.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here in non-diatonic mode, you will get some chords that are not a part of the key. So your next step is to identify whether the chord is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>in the key (a diatonic triad or seventh chord),</li>
    <li>a “Chromatic Variation” (a Neapolitan or Augmented Sixth chord),</li>
    <li>Mode Mixture (borrowed from the relative Major or minor key), or</li>
    <li>an Applied Chord (borrowed from a non-relative key).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These groupings will help you narrow down the specific chord type, which you’ll identify by its chord symbol or roman numeral. For example, if it’s a Chromatic Variation, is it a N6, It+6, Fr+6, or Ger+6 chord? If it’s an Applied Chord, is it V/V, V7/iv, etc. This means you’ll want to know:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>which types of chords are part of the above groupings,</li>
    <li>how to recognize the symbol for each type of chord,</li>
    <li>whether the chord’s quality gives it a capital or lower-case roman numeral, and</li>
    <li>how this compares to the diatonic roman numerals for Major or minor keys.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And finally, once you’ve got the chord type, you’ll need to identify:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the chord’s inversion using figured bass symbols, and</li>
    <li>in the cases of Chromatic Variation or Applied Chords, which chord is most likely to follow.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You’ve got this! All these are concepts we’ve covered in class, and you can always refer to *Nuts+Bolts* or reach out to the teaching staff if you have any questions.</p>
