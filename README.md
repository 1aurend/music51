[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/1aurend/music51.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/1aurend/music51)

Chord Crusher is a chord identification training app.

## Development

Follow these instructions to get you started hacking on the Chord Crusher application.

### 1. Open up your Terminal

Navigate to the `Terminal` application and open it up. We will use this to install the software necessary to develop, test, and run our code.

### 2. Install Homebrew

There are many ways to install the software needed to develop, test, and run our code, but `brew` makes it easy!

To install Homebrew, copy and paste the following code into the terminal:

```Bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then, press **enter** to begin the download and installation.

Once installation is complete, run the following command to make sure that everything went well:

```Bash
brew doctor
```

*For more information, check out Homebrew's [homepage](brew.sh).*

### 3. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

Our application uses [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) for development, testing, and running our app.
